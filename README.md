# Project: Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering**

Objective:
Implement unsupervised machine learning to identify distinct customer segments for targeted marketing strategies.

Methodology:
- Performed comprehensive EDA using automated visualization loops for age, income, and spending patterns with gender-based segmentation
- Applied K-Means clustering with inertia method to determine optimal clusters (k=5)
- Developed both univariate (income-based) and bivariate (income-spending) clustering models
- Created centroid visualizations and cluster profiling for business interpretation

Key Insights:
- Cluster 0: High-income, high-spending customers - target for premium loyalty programs
- Cluster 3: High-income, low-spending customers - require needs assessment surveys
- Cluster 4: Young customers with high spending potential - future major customer base

Technical Stack:
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, K-Means Clustering, Data Visualization, EDA

Deliverables:
Segmented customer database with cluster labels and strategic marketing recommendations for each segment.
